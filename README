To use Oeil_de_Surimi, execute the file Oeil_de_Surimi.

In the tab "Image Processing & OCR", you can select an image and read the characters in it.
To do so, Click on the button "Select..." and choose a image from your computer. The image will be shown to you, and ready to be processed.
You can now click on the following buttons :
* "Grayscale" to turn the image into shades of gray
* "B&W" to binarize the image (only black and white pixels)
* "Denoise" to denoise the image (this feature is not available yet)
* "RLSA" to detect block of text in the image. The blocks found by the algorithm will be highlighted and framed in a red rectangle.

You  can change parameters of those buttons in the "def_config.txt". The "Parameters" is supposed to let you change those parameters, but its not ready yet.

In the tab "IA Training - XOR", you can test our neural network by making it learn the behavior of a XOR gate.
You can change the number of neurons, epochs, and more in this tab. To Train the neural network, press the button "Run NN...".
The neural network will then be tested for different values of inputs, and results will be printed in the "Output" column.
